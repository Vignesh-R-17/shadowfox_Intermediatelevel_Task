🏪 Store Sales Profit Analysis Project
🎯 Project Overview
This project is part of my AI/ML Internship Intermediate Task.
It analyzes store sales data to calculate profits, visualize performance, and optionally apply a simple linear regression model to predict profits.

📊 Objectives
Load and process a store sales dataset.
Add a new column for Profit Margin (%).
Visualize store-wise profits using bar charts.
Save the processed data to an output file.
(Optional) Build a simple linear regression model to predict profit from sales.
🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas – data manipulation
Matplotlib – visualization
Scikit-learn – linear regression (optional)
